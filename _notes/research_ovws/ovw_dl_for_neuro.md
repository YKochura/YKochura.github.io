# Ideas for neuroscience using deep learning

list of comparisons: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qil2ylAnw6XrHPymYjKKYNDJn2qZQYA_Qg2_ijl-MaQ/edit

Modern deep learning evokes many parallels with the human brain. Here, we explore how these two concepts are related and how deep learning can help understand neural systems using big data.

# Brief history

The history of deep learning is intimately linked with neuroscience, with the modern idea of convolutional neural networks dates back to the necognitron<dt-cite key="fukushima1982neocognitron"></dt-cite>.

## pro big-data

Artificial neural networks can compute in several different ways. There is some evidence in the visual system that neurons in higher layers of visual areas can, to some extent, be predicted linearly by higher layers of deep networks<dt-cite key="yamins2014performance"></dt-cite>. However, this certainly isn't true in general.

- when comparing energy-efficiency, must normalize network performance by energy / number of computations / parameters

## anti big-data

- could neuroscientist  understand microprocessor
- no canonical microcircuit

	- pick next stimulus in closed-loop ("adaptive sampling" = "optimal experimental design")
- J. Benda, T. Gollisch, C. K. Machens, and A. V. Herz, “From response to stimulus: adaptive sampling in sensory physiology”
  - find the smallest number of stimuli needed to fit parameters of a model that predicts the recorded neuron’s activity from the
    stimulus

  - maximizing firing rates via genetic algorithms

  - maximizing firing rate via gradient ascent
- C. DiMattina and K. Zhang,“Adaptive stimulus optimization for sensory systems neuroscience"](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2013.00101/full)

  - 2 general approaches: gradient-based approaches + genetic algorithms
  - can put constraints on stimulus space
  - stimulus adaptation
  - might want iso-response surfaces
  - maximally informative stimulus ensembles (Machens, 2002)
  - model-fitting: pick to maximize info-gain w/ model params
  - using fixed stimulus sets like white noise may be deeply problematic for efforts to identify non-linear hierarchical network models due to continuous parameter confounding (DiMattina and Zhang, 2010) 
  - use for model selection
