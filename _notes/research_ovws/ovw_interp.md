# reviews

The definition of interpretability I find most useful is that given in [this work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04592): basically that interpretability requires a pragmatic approach in order to be useful. As such, interpretability is only defined with respect to a specific audience + problem and should always be thought about in a specific context. It has been defined and studied more broadly in a variety of works:

- [Explore, Explain and Examine Predictive Models](https://pbiecek.github.io/ema/) (biecek & burzykowski, in progress) - another book on exploratory analysis with interpretability
- [Explanation Methods in Deep Learning: Users, Values, Concerns and Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07517) (ras et al. 2018)
- [Explainable Deep Learning: A Field Guide for the Uninitiated](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14545.pdf)
- [Interpretable Deep Learning in Drug Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02788)
- [Explainable AI: A Brief Survey on History, Research Areas, Approaches and Challenges](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32236-6_51)
- [Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Concepts, Taxonomies, Opportunities and Challenges toward Responsible AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10045)



## overviews

- [Towards a Generic Framework for Black-box Explanation Methods](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02131174v2/document) (henin & metayer 2019)
  - sampling - selection of inputs to submit to the system to be explained
  - generation - analysis of links between selected inputs and corresponding outputs to generate explanations
    1. *proxy* - approximates model (ex. rule list, linear model)
    2. *explanation generation* - explains the proxy (ex. just give most important 2 features in rule list proxy, ex. LIME gives coefficients of linear model, Shap: sums of elements)
  - interaction (with the user)
  - this is a super useful way to think about explanations (especially local), but doesn't work for SHAP / CD which are more about how much a variable contributes rather than a local approximation

  - some of these can be applied to data directly w/out model (e.g. correlation coefficient, rank correlation coefficient, moment-independent VIMs)

## philosophical perspectives

- [Machine Learning and the Future of Realism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04688.pdf) (hooker & hooker, 2017)
  - lack of interpretability in DNNs is part of what makes them powerful
  - *naked predictions* - numbers with no real interpretation
    - more central to science than modelling?
    - no theory needed? (Breiman 2001)
  - old school: realist studied neuroscience (Wundt), anti-realist just stimuli/response patterns (Skinner), now neither
  - interpretability properties
    - *simplicity* - too complex
    - *risk* - too complex
    - *efficiency* - basically generalizability
    - *unification* - answers *ontology* - the nature of being
    - *realism* in a partially accessible world
  - overall, they believe there is inherent value of ontological description
- [Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: A reality rooted perspective](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.09464v1.pdf) (Emmert-Streib et al. 2020)
  - explainable AI is not a new field but has been already recognized and discussed for expert systems in the 1980s
  1. in some cases, such as simple physics, we can hope to get a **theory** - however, when the underlying process is complicated, interpretation can't hope to simplify it
  2. in other cases, we might hope just for a **description**

# evaluating interpretability

Evaluating interpretability can be very difficult (largely because it rarely makes sense to talk about interpretability outside of a specific context). The best possible evaluation of interpretability requires benchmarking it with respect to the relevant audience in a context. For example, if an interpretation claims to help understand radiology models, it should be tested based on how well it helps radiologists when actually making diagnoses. The papers here try to find more generic alternative ways to evaluate interp methods (or just define desiderata to do so).

# intrinsic interpretability (i.e. how can we fit simpler models)

## interpretable dnns

- [prototypes II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10574) (chen et al. 2018)
  - can have prototypes smaller than original input size
  - l2 distance
  - require the filters to be identical to the latent representation of some training image patch
  - cluster image patches of a particular class around the prototypes of the same class, while separating image patches of different classes
  - maxpool class prototypes so spatial size doesn't matter
  - also get heatmap of where prototype was activated (only max really matters)
  - train in 3 steps
    - train everything: classification + clustering around intraclass prototypes + separation between interclass prototypes (last layer fixed to 1s / -0.5s)
    - project prototypes to data patches
    - learn last layer
- [prototypes I](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04806.pdf) (li et al. 2017)
  - uses encoder/decoder setup
  - encourage every prototype to be similar to at least one encoded input
  - learned prototypes in fact look like digits
  - correct class prototypes go to correct classes
  - loss: classification + reconstruction + distance to a training point

  - entities represented by the class capsule overlap
    - adds additional regularizer

- [Building more accurate decision trees with the additive tree](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/40/19887) (luna et al. 2019)
  - present additive tree (AddTree), which builds a single decision tree, which is between a single CART tree and boosted decision stumps
  - cart can be seen as a boosting algorithm on stumps
    - can rewrite boosted stumps as a tree very easily
    - previous work: can grow tree based on Adaboost idea = AdaTree

## rule lists / sets

- these algorithms usually don't support regression, but you can get regression by cutting the outcome into intervals
- oneR algorithm - select feature that carries most information about the outcome and then split multiple times on that feature
- sequential covering - keep trying to cover more points sequentially
- people are frequently trying to extract rules from trained dnns
- [foundations of rule learning](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2788240) (furnkranz et al. 2014)

- [interpretable classifiers using rules and bayesian analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdfview_1/euclid.aoas/1446488742) (letham et al. 2015)
  - start by mining rules (want them to apply to a large amount of data and not have too many conditions) - uses FP-Growth algorithm (borgelt 2005), could also uses Apriori or Eclat
    - current approach does not allow for negation (e.g. not diabetes) and must split continuous variables into categorical somehow (e.g. quartiles)
    - mines things that frequently occur together, but doesn't look at outcomes in this step - okay (since this is all about finding rules with high support)
  - learn rules w/ prior for short rule conditions and short lists
    - start w/ random list 
    - sample new lists by adding/removing/moving a rule
    - at the end, return the list that had the highest probability

  - make rule lists, then compare the outcomes for each rule with what clinicians think should be outcome for each rule
    - look at rules with biggest disagreement and engineer/improve rules or penalize unreliable rules

## gams

- gam takes form $g(\mu) = b + f(x_0) + f(x_1) + f(x_2) + ...$
  - usually assume some basis for the $f$, like splines or polynomials (and we select how many either manually or with some complexity penalty)

  - gams - assume model form is additive combination of some funcs, then solve via GD
  - however, if we don't know the form of the model we must generate it
- [Bridging the Gap: Providing Post-Hoc Symbolic Explanations for Sequential Decision-Making Problems with Black Box Simulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01080)

# posthoc interpretability (i.e. how can we interpret a fitted model)

## model-agnostic methods

- local surrogate ([LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938)) - fit a simple model locally to on point and interpret that
   - select data perturbations and get new predictions
     - for tabular data, this is just varying the values around the prediction
     - for images, this is turning superpixels on/off
     - superpixels determined in unsupervised way
   - weight the new samples based on their proximity
   - train a kernel-weighted, interpretable model on these points
   - LEMNA - like lime but uses lasso + small changes
- [anchors](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI18/paper/view/16982/15850) (ribeiro et al. 2018) - find biggest square region of input space that contains input and preserves same output (with high precision)
   1. does this search via iterative rules
- [What made you do this? Understanding black-box decisions with sufficient input subsets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03805.pdf)
   - want to find smallest subsets of features which can produce the prediction
     - other features are masked or imputed

- **[shapley value](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predicti)** - average marginal contribution of a feature value across all possible sets of feature values
  - "how much does prediction change on average when this feature is added?"
  - tells us the difference between the actual prediction and the average prediction
  - estimating: all possible sets of feature values have to be evaluated with and without the j-th feature
    - this includes sets of different sizes
    - to evaluate, take expectation over all the other variables, fixing this variables value
  - shapley sampling value - sample instead of exactly computing
    - quantitative input influence is similar to this...
  - satisfies 3 properties
      - local accuracy - basically, explanation scores sum to original prediction
      - missingness - features with $x'_i=0$ have 0 impact
      - consistency - if a model changes so that some simplified input’s contribution increases or stays the same regardless of the other inputs, that input’s attribution should not decrease.
  - interpretation: Given the current set of feature values, the contribution of a feature value to the
    difference between the actual prediction and the mean prediction is the estimated Shapley value.
  - recalculate via sampling other features in expectation
  - followup [propagating shapley values](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11888.pdf) (chen, lundberg, & lee 2019) - can work with stacks of different models

- [quantitative input influence](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7546525) - similar to shap but more general
- permutation importance - increase in the prediction error after we permuted the feature's values
  - $\mathbb E[Y] - \mathbb E[Y\vert X_{\sim i}]$
  - If features are correlated, the permutation feature importance can be biased by unrealistic data
  instances (PDP problem)
  - not the same as model variance
  - Adding a correlated feature can decrease the importance of the associated feature

### feature interactions

How interactions are defined and summarized is a very difficult thing to specify. For example, interactions can change based on monotonic transformations of features (e.g. $y= a \cdot b$, $\log y = \log a + \log b$). Nevertheless, when one has a specific question it can make sense to pursue finding and understanding interactions.

- build-up = context-free, less faithful: score is contribution of only variable of interest ignoring other variables
- break-down = occlusion = context-dependent, more faithful: score is contribution of variable of interest given all other variables (e.g. permutation test - randomize var of interest from right distr.)
- *H-statistic*: 0 for no interaction, 1 for complete interaction
  - how much of the variance of the output of the joint partial dependence is explained by the interaction instead of the individuals
  - $H^2_{jk} = \underbrace{\sum_i [\overbrace{PD(x_j^{(i)}, x_k^{(i)})}^{\text{interaction}} \overbrace{- PD(x_j^{(i)}) - PD(x_k^{(i)})}^{\text{individual}}]^2}_{\text{sum over data points}} \: / \: \underbrace{\sum_i [PD(x_j^{(i)}, x_k^{(i)})}_{\text{normalization}}]^2$
  - alternatively, using ANOVA decomp: $H_{jk}^2 = \sum_i g_{ij}^2 / \sum_i (\mathbb E [Y \vert X_i, X_j])^2$
  - same assumptions as PDP: features need to be independent
- alternatives
  - variable interaction networks (Hooker, 2004) - decompose pred into main effects + feature interactions
  - PDP-based feature interaction (greenwell et al. 2018)
- feature-screening (feng ruan's work)
  - want to find beta which is positive when a variable is important
  - idea: maximize difference between (distances for interclass) and (distances for intraclass)
  - using an L1 distance yields better gradients than an L2 distance
- methods for finding frequent item sets
  - [random intersection trees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.6223.pdf)
  - [fp-growth](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/fp-growth-algorithm-data-mining/)

### vim (variable importance measure) framework

- VIM
	1. a quantitative indicator that quantifies the change of model output value w.r.t. the change or permutation of one or a set of input variables
	2. an indicator that quantifies the contribution of the uncertainties of one or a set of input variables to the uncertainty of model output variable
	3. an indicator that quantifies the strength of dependence between the model output variable and one or a set of input variables. 
- difference-based - deriv=based methods, local importance measure, morris' screening method
    - **LIM** (local importance measure) - like LIME
      - can normalize weights by values of x, y, or ratios of their standard deviations
      - can also decompose variance to get the covariances between different variables
      - can approximate derivative via adjoint method or smth else
    - **morris' screening method**
      - take a grid of local derivs and look at the mean / std of these derivs
      - can't distinguish between nonlinearity / interaction
    - using the squared derivative allows for a close connection w/ sobol's total effect index
      - can extend this to taking derivs wrt different combinations of variables
- parametric regression
  - correlation coefficient, linear reg coeffeicients
  - **partial correlation coefficient** (PCC) - wipe out correlations due to other variables
    - do a linear regression using the other variables (on both X and Y) and then look only at the residuals
  - rank regression coefficient - better at capturing nonlinearity
  - could also do polynomial regression
  - more techniques (e.g. relative importance analysis RIA)
    - nonparametric regression
      - use something like LOESS, GAM, projection pursuit
      - rank variables by doing greedy search (add one var at a time) and seeing which explains the most variance
- hypothesis test
  - **grid-based hypothesis tests**: splitting the sample space (X, Y) into grids and then testing whether the patterns of sample distributions across different grid cells are random
    - ex. see if means vary
    - ex. look at entropy reduction
  - other hypothesis tests include the squared rank difference, 2D kolmogorov-smirnov test, and distance-based tests
- variance-based vim (sobol's indices)
  - **ANOVA decomposition** - decompose model into conditional expectations $Y = g_0 + \sum_i g_i (X_i) + \sum_i \sum_{j > i} g_{ij} (X_i, X_j) + \dots + g_{1,2,..., p}$
    - $g_0 = \mathbf E (Y)\\ g_i = \mathbf E(Y \vert X_i) - g_0 \\ g_{ij} = \mathbf E (Y \vert X_i, X_j) - g_i - g_j - g_0\\...$
    - take variances of these terms
    - if there are correlations between variables some of these terms can misbehave
    - note: $V(Y) = \sum_i V (g_i) + \sum_i \sum_{j > i} V(g_{ij}) + ... V(g_{1,2,...,p})$ - variances are orthogonal and all sum to total variance
    - [anova decomposition basics](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~owen/mc/A-anova.pdf) - factor function into means, first-order terms, and interaction terms
  - $S_i$: **Sobol’s main effect** index: $=V(g_i)=V(E(Y \vert X_i))=V(Y)-E(V(Y \vert X_i))$
    - small value indicates $X_i$ is non-influential
    - usually used to select important variables
  - $S_{Ti}$: **Sobol's total effect** index - include all terms (even interactions) involving a variable
  - equivalently, $V(Y) - V(E[Y \vert X_{\sim i}])$
    - usually used to screen unimportant variables
      - it is common to normalize these indices by the total variance $V(Y)$
    - three methods for computation - Fourire amplitude sensitivity test, meta-model, MCMC
    - when features are correlated, these can be strange (often inflating the main effects)
      - can consider $X_i^{\text{Correlated}} = E(X_i \vert X_{\sim i})$ and $X_i^{\text{Uncorrelated}} = X_i - X_i^{\text{Correlated}}$
  - this can help us understand the contributions that come from different features, as well as the correlations between features (e.g. $S_i^{\text{Uncorrelated}} = V(E[Y \vert X_i^{\text{Uncorrelated}}])/V(Y)$
    - [sobol indices connected to shapley value](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/130936233)
      - $SHAP_i = \underset{S, i \in S}{\sum} V(g_S) / \vert S \vert$
- moment-independent vim
  - want more than just the variance ot the output variables
  - e.g. **delta index** = average dist. between $f_Y(y)$ and $f_{Y \vert X_i}(y)$ when $X_i$ is fixed over its full distr.
    - $\delta_i = \frac 1 2 \mathbb E \int \vert f_Y(y) - f_{Y\vert X_i} (y) \vert dy = \frac 1 2 \int \int \vert f_{Y, X_i}(y, x_i) - f_Y(y) f_{X_i}(x_i) \vert dy \,dx_i$
    - moment-independent because it depends on the density, not just any moment (like measure of dependence between $y$ and $X_i$
  - can also look at KL, max dist..
- graphic vim - like curves
  - e.g. scatter plot, meta-model plot, regional VIMs, parametric VIMs
  - CSM - relative change of model ouput mean when range of $X_i$ is reduced to any subregion
  - CSV - same thing for variance

## model-agnostic curves

- **pdp plots** - marginals (force value of plotted var to be what you want it to be)
- separate into **ice plots**  - marginals for instance
  - average of ice plots = pdp plot
  - sometimes these are centered, sometimes look at derivative
- both pdp ice suffer from many points possibly not being real
- possible solution: **Marginal plots M-plots** (bad name - uses conditional, not marginal)
  - only use points conditioned on certain variable
  - problem: this bakes things in (e.g. if two features are correlated and only one important, will say both are important)
- **ALE-plots** - take points conditioned on value of interest, then look at differences in predictions around a window
  - this gives pure effect of that var and not the others
  - needs an order (i.e. might not work for caterogical)
  - doesn't give you individual curves
  - recommended very highly by the book...
  - they integrate as you go...
- summary: To summarize how each type of plot (PDP, M, ALE) calculates the effect of a feature at a certain grid value v:
   - Partial Dependence Plots: “Let me show you what the model predicts on average when each data instance has the value v for that feature. I ignore whether the value v makes sense for all data instances.” 
- M-Plots: “Let me show you what the model predicts on average for data instances that have values close to v for that feature. The effect could be due to that feature, but also due to correlated features.” 
  - ALE plots: “Let me show you how the model predictions change in a small “window” of the feature around v for data instances in that window.” 

## example-based explanations

- influential instances - want to find important data points
- deletion diagnostics - delete a point and see how much it changed
- [influence funcs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04730) (koh & liang, 2017): use **Hessian** ($\theta x \theta$) to give effect of upweighting a point
  - influence functions = inifinitesimal approach - upweight one person by infinitesimally small weight and see how much estimate changes (e.g. calculate first derivative)
  - influential instance - when data point removed, has a strong effect on the model (not necessarily same as an outlier)
  - requires access to gradient (e.g. nn, logistic regression)
  - take single step with Newton's method after upweighting loss
  - yield change in parameters by removing one point
  - yield change in loss at one point by removing a different point (by multiplying above by cahin rule)
  - yield change in parameters by modifying one point

## tree ensembles

- [Explainable AI for Trees: From Local Explanations to Global Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04610) (lundberg et al. 2019)
  - shap-interaction scores - distribute among pairwise interactions + local effects
  - plot lots of local interactions together - helps detect trends
  - propose doing shap directly on loss function (identify how features contribute to loss instead of prediction)
  - can run supervised clustering (where SHAP score is the label) to get meaningful clusters
    - alternatively, could do smth like CCA on the model output
- [conditional variable importance for random forests](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-307) (strobl et al. 2008)
  - propose permuting conditioned on the values of variables not being permuted
    - to find region in which to permute, define the grid within which the values of $X_j$ are permuted for each tree by means of the partition of the feature space induced by that tree
  - many scores (such as MDI, MDA) measure marginal importance, not conditional importance
    - as a result, correlated variables get importances which are too high
- [treeshap](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03888) (lundberg, erion & lee, 2019): prediction-level
  - individual feature attribution: want to decompose prediction into sum of attributions for each feature
    - each thing can depend on all features
  - Saabas method: basic thing for tree
    - you get a pred at end
    - count up change in value at each split for each variable
  - three properties
    - local acc - decomposition is exact
    - missingness - features that are already missing are attributed no importance
      - for missing feature, just (weighted) average nodes from each split
    - consistency - if F(X) relies more on a certain feature j, $F_j(x)$ should 
      - however Sabaas method doesn't change $F_j(X)$ for $F'(x) = F(x) + x_j$
  - these 3 things iply we want shap values
  - average increase in func value when selecting i (given all subsets of other features)
  - for binary features with totally random splits, same as Saabas
  - **can cluster based on explanation similarity** (fig 4)
    - can quantitatively evaluate based on clustering of explanations
  - their fig 8 - qualitatively can see how different features alter outpu
  - gini importance is like weighting all of the orderings

    - assume all categorical
    - randomly pick feature at each depth, split on all possibilities

## concept-based explanations
- [concept activation vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.11279)
    - Given: a user-defined set of examples for a concept (e.g., ‘striped’), and random
            examples, labeled training-data examples for the studied class (zebras) 
        - given trained network
        - TCAV can quantify the model’s sensitivity to the concept for that class. CAVs are learned by training a linear classifier to distinguish between the activations produced by
            a concept’s examples and examples in any layer
        - CAV - vector orthogonal to the classification boundary
        - TCAV uses the derivative of the CAV direction wrt input
    - [automated concept activation vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03129) - Given a set of concept discovery images, each image is segmented with different resolutions to find concepts that are captured best at different sizes. (b) After removing duplicate segments, each segment is resized tothe original input size resulting in a pool of resized segments of the discovery images. (c) Resized segments are mapped to a model’s activation space at a bottleneck layer. To discover the concepts associated with the target class, clustering with outlier removal is performed. (d) The output of our method is a set of discovered concepts for each class, sorted by their importance in prediction

## dnn feature importance

- saliency maps
    1. occluding parts of the image
      - sweep over image and remove patches
      - which patch removals had highest impact on change in class?
    2. text usually uses attention maps
      - ex. karpathy et al LSTMs
      - ex. lei et al. - most relevant sentences in sentiment prediction
    3. class-activation map - sum the activations across channels (weighted by their weight for a particular class)
    4. [RISE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07421.pdf) (Petsiuk et al. 2018) - randomized input sampling
       1. randomly mask the images, get prediction
       2. saliency map = sum of masks weighted by the produced predictions
- gradient-based methods - visualize what in image would change class label
  - gradient * input
  - [integrated gradients](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/sundararajan17a/sundararajan17a.pdf) (sundararajan et al. 2017) - just sum up the gradients from some baseline to the image (in 1d, this is just $f(x) - f(baseline))$
    - in higher dimensions, such as images, we pick the path to integrate by starting at some baseline (e.g. all zero) and then get gradients as we interpolate between the zero image and the real image
    - if we picture 2 features, we can see that integrating the gradients will not just yield $f(x) - f(baseline)$, because each time we evaluate the gradient we change both features
    - [explanation distill article](https://distill.pub/2020/attribution-baselines/) 
      - ex. any pixels which are same in original image and modified image will be given 0 importance
      - lots of different possible choices for baseline (e.g. random Gaussian image, blurred image, random image from the training set)
      - could also average over distributions of baseline (this yields **expected gradients**)
      - when we do a Gaussian distr., this is very similar to smoothgrad

  - Label  "wins" a pixel if either (a) its map assigns that pixel a positive score higher than the scores assigned by every other label ora negative score lower than the scores assigned by every other label. 
  - final saliency map consists of scores assigned by the chosen label to each pixel it won, with the map containing a score 0 for any pixel it did not win.
  - can be applied to any method which satisfies completeness (sum of pixel scores is exactly the logit value)

  - can use quantile loss to penalize models differently
  - than can use these different models to get confidence intervals
  - [can easily do this with sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.html)
  - quantile loss = $\begin{cases} \alpha \cdot \Delta & \text {if} \quad \Delta > 0\\(\alpha - 1) \cdot \Delta & \text{if} \quad \Delta < 0\end{cases}$
    - $\Delta =$ actual - predicted

    - could use one model to get uncertainty and other model to predict
  - [Evaluating Scalable Bayesian Deep Learning Methods for Robust Computer Vision](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.01620.pdf)
    - **epistemic uncertainty** - uncertainty in the DNN model parameters
      - without good estimates of this, often get aleatoric uncertainty wrong (since $p(y\vert x) = \int p(y \vert x, \theta) p(\theta \vert data) d\theta$
    - **aleatoric uncertainty** -  inherent and irreducible data noise (e.g. features contradict each other)
      - this can usually be gotten by predicting a distr. $p(y \vert x)$ instead of a point estimate
      - ex. logistic reg. already does this
      - ex. regression - just predict mean and variance of Gaussian
