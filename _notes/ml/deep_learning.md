# neural networks

- basic perceptron update rule
    - if output is 0 but should be 1: raise weights on active connections by d
    - if output is 1 but should be 0: lower weights on active connections by d
- *perceptron convergence thm* - if data is linearly separable, perceptron learning algorithm wiil converge
- transfer / activation functions
    - sigmoid(z) = $\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$
    - Binary step
    - TanH (always preferred to sigmoid)
    - Rectifier = ReLU
         - Leaky ReLU - still has some negative slope when <0
         - rectifying in electronics converts analog -> digital
    - rare to mix and match neuron types
- *deep* - more than 1 hidden layer
- regression loss = $\frac{1}{2}(y-\hat{y})^2$
- classification loss = $-y log (\hat{y}) - (1-y) log(1-\hat{y})$ 
    - can't use SSE because not convex here
- multiclass classification loss $=-\sum_j y_j ln \hat{y}_j$
- **backpropagation** - application of *reverse mode automatic differentiation* to neural networks's loss
  - apply the chain rule from the end of the program back towards the beginning
    - $\frac{dL}{dx_i} = \frac{dL}{dz} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x_i}$
    - sum $\frac{dL}{dz}$ if neuron has multiple outputs z
    - L is output
  - $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x_i}$ is actually a Jacobian (deriv each $z_i$ wrt each $x_i$ - these are vectors)
    - each gate usually has some sparsity structure so you don't compute whole Jacobian
- pipeline
  - initialize weights, and final derivative ($\frac{dL}{dL}=1$)
  - for each batch
    - run network forward to compute outputs at each step
    - compute gradients at each gate with backprop
    - update weights with SGD
- ![backprop](assets/deep_learning/backprop.png)

# training

- *vanishing gradients problem* - neurons in earlier layers learn more slowly than in later layers
  - happens with sigmoids
  - dead ReLus
- *exploding gradients problem* - gradients are significantly larger in earlier layers than later layers
  - RNNs
- *batch normalization* - whiten inputs to all neurons (zero mean, variance of 1)
  - do this for each input to the next layer
- *dropout* - randomly zero outputs of p fraction of the neurons during training
  - like learning large ensemble of models that share weights
  - 2 ways to compensate (pick one)
    1. at test time multiply all neurons' outputs by p
    2. during training divide all neurons' outputs by p
- *softmax* - takes vector z and returns vector of the same length
  - makes it so output sums to 1 (like probabilities of classes)

# CNNs
- kernel here means filter
- convolution G- takes a windowed average of an image F with a filter H where the filter is flipped horizontally and vertically before being applied
- G = H $\ast$ F
    - if we do a filter with just a 1 in the middle, we get the exact same image
    - you can basically always pad with zeros as long as you keep 1 in middle
    - can use these to detect edges with small convolutions
    - can do Guassian filters
- convolutions typically sum over all color channels
- 1x1 conv - still convolves over channels
- pooling - usually max - doesn't pool over depth
  - people trying to move away from this - larger strides in conversation layers
  - stacking small layers is generally better
- most of memory impact is usually from activations from each layer kept around for backdrop
- visualizations
    - layer activations (maybe average over channels)
    - visualize the weights (maybe average over channels)v
    - feed a bunch of images and keep track of which activate a neuron most
    - t-SNE embedding of images
    - occluding
- weight matrices have special structure (Toeplitz or block Toeplitz)
- input layer is usually centered (subtract mean over training set)
- usually crop to fixed size (square input)
- receptive field - input region
- stride m - compute only every mth pixel
- downsampling
    - max pooling - backprop error back to neuron w/ max value
    - average pooling - backprop splits error equally among input neurons
- data augmentation - random rotations, flips, shifts, recolorings
- siamese networks - extract features twice with same net then put layer on top
    - ex. find how similar to representations are
- famous cnns

		- first, used on MNIST
	- AlexNet (2012)
		- landmark (5 conv layers, some pooling/dropout)

		- fine tuning and deconvnet
	- VGGNet (2014)
		- 19 layers, all 3x3 conv layers and 2x2 maxpooling
  - GoogLeNet (2015)
	  - lots of parallel elements (called *Inception module*)
	- Msft ResNet (2015)
        - very deep - 152 layers
            - connections straight from initial layers to end
          - only learn "residual" from top to bottom
	- Region Based CNNs (R-CNN - 2013, Fast R-CNN - 2015, Faster R-CNN - 2015)
		- object detection
	- Karpathy Generating image descriptions (2014)
		- RNN+CNN
	- Spatial transformer networks (2015)
		- transformations within the network
	- Segnet (2015)
		- encoder-decoder network
	- Unet (2015)
		- Ronneberger - applies to biomedical segmentation
	- Pixelnet (2017)
        - predicts pixel-level for different tasks with the same architecture
        - convolutional layers then 3 FC layers which use outputs from all convolutional layrs together

	- Yolonet
	- Wavenet
	- Densenet
	- NASNET
	- [Efficientnet (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.11946.pdf)



# architectural components

- **coordconv** - break translation equivariance by passing in i, j coords as extra filters
- **deconvolution** = transposed convolution = fractionally-strided convolution - like upsampling
- **attention**
    - attention ovw: https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html
    - vector of importance weights: in order to predict or infer one element, such as a pixel in an image or a word in a sentence, we estimate using the attention vector how strongly it is correlated with (or “*attends to*” as you may have read in many papers) other elements and take the sum of their values weighted by the attention vector as the approximation of the target.
    - attention [born](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf) to solve problem of going from arbitrary length -> fixed length encoding -> arbitrary length output

# recent trends
- architecture search: learning to learn
- *optimal brain damage* - starts with fully connected and weeds out connections (Lecun)
- *tiling* - train networks on the error of previous networks

# RNNs

- feedforward NNs have no memory so we introduce recurrent NNs
- able to have memory
- could theoretically unfold the network and train with backprop
- truncated - limit number of times you unfold
- $state_{new} = f(state_{old},input_t)$
- ex. $h_t = tanh(W h_{t-1}+W_2 x_t)$
- train with backpropagation through time (unfold through time)
    - truncated backprop through time - only run every k time steps
- error gradients vanish exponentially quickly with time lag

## LSTMs
- have gates for forgetting, input, output
- easy to let hidden state flow through time, unchanged
- gate $\sigma$ - pointwise multiplication
    - multiply by 0 - let nothing through
    - multiply by 1 - let everything through
- forget gate - conditionally discard previously remembered info
- input gate - conditionally remember new info
- output gate - conditionally output a relevant part of memory
- GRUs - similar, merge input / forget units into a single update unit \vert 

# adversarial attacks

- **adversarial attack** - designing an input to get the wrong result from the model
  - **targeted** - try to get specific wrong class
- fast gradient step method - keep adding gradient to maximize noise (limit amplitude of pixel's channel to stay imperceptible)
