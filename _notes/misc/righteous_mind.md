# i - intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second
- elephant and rider metaphor

### 1 - where does morality come from
1. *nativist* - morality is innate
2. *empiricist* - morality is from childhood learning
3. *rationalist* - morality is self-constructed by children on the basis of their experience with harm
	- kids know harm is wrong because they hate to be harmed and learn its is wrong to harm others
	- came to reject this answer
- new study
	- moral domain *varies by culture*
		- rich, westerners tend to differentiate between social constructions and moral harms while others don't
		- westerners are *individualistic* - harm and fairness
		- other cultures are *sociocentric*
	- disgust and disrepect drive reasoning - moral reasoning is posthoc fabrication
- in fact, morality is probably some combination of 1 & 2

### 2 - intuitive dog and rational tail
1. Plato - reason (mind) is master of emotions
2. Hume - reason is the servant of passions
3. Jefferson - reason and sentiment are indpeendent co-rulers
- Haidt believes in 2
- Antonio Damasio writes Descartes' error where patients are missing ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)
	- they couldn't have emotion
	- where difficult to reason without emotion - too many choices
- *intuitionism* - calls  reasoning *rider* and intution *elephant*
	- rider developed to help elephant
	- *social intuitionism* - other people can alter intuitions
	
### 3 - elephants rule
- brain can make snap judgements in 1/10 second
	- can predict 2/3 outcomes of senate / house elections based on attractiveness in this time
- intuitions come first, strategic reasoning second
- smells etc can influence our moral judgements

### 4 - vote for me (and here's why)
- conscious reasoning immediately justifies intuitive response
- self-esteem doesn't make evolutionary sense, since being in groups was what mattered
	- rather, self-esteem measure's one's fitness as a mate / group member
- experimental evidence for confirmation bias
- moral/political matters - we are often *groupish* rather than selfish


# ii - there's more to morality than harm and fairness
- be suspicious of moral monomists

### 5 - beyond WEIRD mentality	
- WEIRD - western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic - outliars, but often used
- Schweder's three ethics
	1. *autonomy* - individual rights
	2. *community* - group relationships
	3. *divinity* - purity
- there is more to morality than harm and fairness

### 6 - taste buds of the righteous mind / 7 - the moral foundations of politics
- *deontology* - rule-based ethics
- moral psychology should be empirical - how the mind works, not how it ought to work
- Moral Foundations Theory
	1. care
		- evolved to care for young
	2. fairness
		- punish cheaters
		- finding altruistic partner
	3. liberty
	4. loyalty
		- want people that are good team players
	5. authority
		- allows us to thrive in hierarchical settings
	6. sanctity
		- starts with omnivore's dillema
		- survive pathogens

### 8 - the conservative advantage
- Durkheim - basic unit is family, not individual
- liberals only really value first three moral foundations

# iii - morality binds and blinds

### 9 - why are we so groupish
- group selection is controversial
- here are 3 exhibits defending it
	1. major transitions produce superorganisms
	2. shared intentionality generates moral matrices
		- chimpanzees have no shared intentionality
	3. genes and cultures coevolve
	4. evolution can be fast

### 10 - the hive switch
- two candidates for hive switch
	1. oxytocin genes
	2. mirror neurons
- hive switch doesn't seem to be for everyone, but rather just for one's group

### 11 - religion is a team sport	
- descriptive definitions - describe what people think are moral
- normative definitions - describe what is truly right
	- utilitarianism
	- deontology
- belief in supernatural - could be accidental as by-product of hypersensitive agency detection device
- religion can effectively surpress free-rider problem

### 12 - disagreeing more constructively
- people are predisposed to ideologies
- then there is serious confirmation bias
- liberals and conservatives are both necessary to balance each other out
- *Manichaeism* - polarization, believing one side only
- imagine world with no countries, religion -> would probably be chaos
