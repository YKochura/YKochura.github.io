# i. sex, romance, and love

## 1. darwin comes of age
- *Emile Durkheim* - father of modern sociology
- *Wilson* - initial book sociobiology was vehemently opposed
	- reactive against connotations of *social darwinism*
		- social darwinism is linked to eugenics
- genes affect human nature in two ways
	1. existence of guilt
	2. developmental program to calibrate guilt

## 2. male and female
- have to consider environment of evolutionary adaptation (EEA)
- many studies on !Kung San of the Kalahari desert in Africa
- throughout nature, females are more coy while males are more promiscuous
	- this is true of every known human society
	- Samoa example was thought to be different, but this study was refuted
	- true with turkeys (who can be seduced by a wooden female turkey head)
- difference is due to amount of male parental investment
- apes
	- ex. gorilla alpha male claims all the women
	- ex. gibbons are monogamous - live in family units separate from others
		- sing duets

## 3. men and women
- ideas that humans are a *pair-bonding species*
	- humans require high male parental investment (MPI)
	- vulnerable offspring
	- more education from two parents
- for men, worst thing is raising a child that isn't theres
	- men are most angry at sexual infidelity
	- sometimes killed children that weren't theirs
	- quantity of sperm depends heavily on the amount of time a man's mate has been out of his sight lately
- for women, worst thing is being abandoned
	- women are most angry at emotional infidelity
- why can women still be unfaithful
	1. women were able to extract gifts for sex - "resource extraction"
	2. they don't advertise their ovulation - "seeds of confusion"
- *madonna-whore dichotomy* - group women into 2 categories: to marry or to have sex with and abandon
	- perhaps example of *frequency-dependent selection*
	- ex. blugill sunfish 
		1. normal males make nests and guard eggs
		2. drifter males sneak around and fertilize others' eggs
		- nature strikes a balance between both
	- in actuality, should be able to guage situation and switch between different behaviors
	- *self-esteem* might be biological marker that helps with this
- men are more likely to gain from leaving a marriage
	- wome only have ~25 fertile years

## 4. the marriage market
- polygamy, initially, seems to benefit men
	- one man can get more females
- why monogamy
	1. *ecologically imposed* - if people are struggling to survive, a woman shouldn't share a man with another
		- they won't have enough resources
	2. *socially imposed* - in economic unequal societies (like today)
		- these societies are the ones that have dowry
		- imagine 1000 men and 1000 women -> polygyny actually hurts the men
		- therefore, monogamy likely evolved to stop the dangers of men without wives
- current divorce rates are high, hurting all alike

## 5/6. darwin's marriage
- Charles Darwin focused on wealth, Emma focused on looks, they were married happily

# ii. social cement

## 7. families
- altruism makes sense for kin - wasps, ants
	- part of kin selection theory by Hamilton
	- some ants are sterile and only defend nests
- genes try to propagate *themselves* not individuals or groups
- $r$ - represents *degree of relatedness*
	- brother = 1/2
	- aunt = 1/4
	- cousin = 1/8
	- for some organisms, like slime mold, r=1
	- higher average r leads to more altruism
- children look after themselves first, then siblings
	- parents need to teach them to share
	- children are biologically inclined to listen to their parents when young
- biological evidence: wealthy people focus on boy children, poor on girls
	- measure in how many years after first child for next child
	- makes sense since male's reproductive potential is more affected by societal status
	- this same trend should show up for siblings (poor children are nicer to girl siblings)
- parents grieve most of children around adolescent age
	- this maps perfectly the reproductive potential of !Kung people

## 8. darwin and the savages
- evolution: kin-selection -> reciprocal altruism (tit for tat) -> higher morals
- against group selection - even if it helped a group, it would start to decay within the group

## 9. friends
- helping others is not zero-sum
	- lets you catch big game, spread information
- late 1970s Axelrod devises competition for prisoner's dillema programs
	- *TIT for TAT* programs wins - do what person did last
	- very simple for early ancestors to implement
	- designed for *individuals* not *groups*
- TIT for TAT doesn't work unless lots of people do it
	- kin selection gave it a boost
	- not sure about aunts, uncles, etc.
	- people try to maintain appearances of dignity
- once reciprocal altruism is entrenched, can have "good for the group" type genes

## 10. darwin's conscience
- moral guidance is made to be guided by peers / parents
- lying can be useful
	- lying can be genetically made exciting to teach its usefulness
- modern society generally has more lying
	- this is to be expected as groups get larger and have more immigration and emigration

# iii. social strife

## 11. darwin's delay
- darwin studies barnacles for a while, probably because he was afraid to unveil his iconoclastic theory

## 12. social status
- hierarchy exists almost everywhere
- even societies that have shared resources didn't share social status, females, etc.
- group-selection for hierarchy doesn't make sense - individual fitness in anarchy is fine
- 2 theories
	1. *pecking order*
		- if you leave hens, after some combat they settle into a pecking order
		- hen A pecks B with impunity, B pecks C, so on in order to settle disputes for resources
		- they all respect this
		- genes endowing a chicken with this selective fear should flourish
	2. *John Maynard Smith's* evolutionary *steady state*
		- hawk-dove analysis of birds
		- both strategies make sense in proportions
- males genetically tend to be most ambitious, seek social status
	- Sharifian emperor of Morocco credited with 888 children
- hierarchy comes after reciprocal altruism
	- status assistance could be main purpose of friendship
- *Machiavellianism* is "the employment of cunning and duplicity in statecraft or in general conduct"
- what we call cultural values are expedients to social success

## 13. deception and self-deception
- it is more important to give the appearance of altruism than actually be altruistic
- some of our motives are hidden from us not incidentally but by design, so that we can credibly act as if they aren't what they are
- low *self-esteem* - way to reconcile people to subordinate status
- *galvanic skin response* (GSR) - rises if people hear their own voice
	- people somtimes can't consciously identify their own voice even when GSR can
	- they recognize it more when they have more confidence
- *glumness*
	1. self-esteem deflator
	2. negative reinforcement
	3. course changer
- *split-brain* patients make up reasons
	- one hemisphere gives them command walk
	- when asked why walking, they make something up
- NYT quote: "In a week's time, both sides have constructed deeply emotional stories explaining their roles, one-sided accounts that are offered with impassioned conviction, although in many respects they do not stand up, in either case, under careful scrutiny."

## 14. darwin's triumph
- people were willing to profess incorrect opinions about the relative length of two lines if placed in a room with other people who professed them

# iv. morals of the story

## 15. darwinian (and freudian) cynicism
- Freud
	1. id - animal
	2. ego - interprets id to superego
	3. superego

## 16. evolutionary ethics
- John Mill's *utilitarianism* is a good starting point
- morality best preserves non-zero sumness

## 17. blaming the victim
- "genetic determinism" pops up in court cases (cases like insanity)
	- notion of free will is shrinking
- less retributive of justice - more emphasis on deterrence, improving utilitarianism
- rage of juries may wane as they come to believe that male philandering is "natural"

## 18. darwin gets religion
- doctrines thus far likely have "harmony" with human nature
- we are designed to believe that next rung on ladder will bring bliss, but in reality it will evaporate shortly after we get there
- why religion
	1. power to religion makers
	2. mutual benefits for leaders and people
	3. we came to empathize with all people
	
## general tips
1. distinguish between behavior and mental organ governing it
2. remember that mental organ, not behavior, is what was actually designed by natural selection
3. these organs may no longer ba daptive
4. human mind is incredibly complex
