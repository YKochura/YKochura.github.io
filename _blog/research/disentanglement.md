# VAEs

*Some good disentangled VAE implementations are [here](https://github.com/YannDubs/disentangling-vae) and more general VAE implementations are [here](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE)*.

The goal is to obtain a nice latent representation $\mathbf z$ for our inputs $\mathbf x$. To do this, we learn parameters $\phi$ for the encoder $p_\phi( \mathbf z\vert \mathbf x)$ and $\theta$ for the decoder $q_{\mathbf \theta} ( \mathbf x\vert \mathbf z)$. We do this with the standard vae setup, whereby a code $z$ is sampled, using the output of the encoder (intro to VAEs [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/intuitively-understanding-variational-autoencoders-1bfe67eb5daf)).



## disentangled vae loss function

$$\overbrace{\mathbb E_{p_\phi(\mathbf z \vert \mathbf x)}}^{\text{Samples}} [ \underbrace{-\log q_{\mathbf \theta} ( \mathbf x\vert \mathbf z)}_{\text{reconstruction loss}} ] + {\color{teal}\beta}; \sum_i \underbrace{\text{KL} \left(p*\phi( \mathbf z_i\vert \mathbf x):\vert \vert:prior(\mathbf z_i) \right)}_{\text{compactness prior loss}} + \gamma ; \underbrace{\text{KL} \left( q*\phi(\mathbf z\vert \mathbf x) \vert \vert \prod_i q_\phi( \mathbf z_i\vert \mathbf x) \right)}_{\text{total correlation loss}}$$


| reconstruction loss                             | compactness prior loss                           |         total correlation loss             |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------: |
| encourages accurate reconstruction of the input | encourages points to be compactly placed in space | encourages latent variables to be independent |


- summarizing the losses
  - **reconstruction loss** - measures the quality of the reconstruction, the form of the loss changes based on the assumed distribution of the likelihood of each pixel
    - *binary cross entropy loss* - corresopnds to bernoulli distr., most common - doesn't penalize (0.1, 0.2) and (0.4, 0.5) the same way, which might be problematic
    - *mse loss* - gaussian distr. - tends to focus on a fex pixels that are very wrong
    - *l1 loss* - laplace distr.
  - **compactness prior loss**
    - doesn't use the extra injected latent noise
    - tries to push all the points to the same place
    - emphasises smoothness of z, using as few dimensions of z as possible, and the main axes of z to capture most of the data variability
    - usually assume prior is standard normal, resulting in pushing the code means to 0 and code variance to 1
    - we can again split this term $\sum_i \underbrace{\text{KL} \left(p_\phi( \mathbf z_i\vert \mathbf x)\:\vert\vert\:prior(\mathbf z_i) \right)}_{\text{compactness prior loss}} = \underbrace{\sum_i I(x; z)}_{\text{mutual info}} + \underbrace{\text{KL} \left(p_\phi( \mathbf z_i)\:\vert\vert\:prior(\mathbf z_i) \right)}_{\text{factorial prior loss}}$
      - (see [factor-vae paper for proof](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05983.pdf))
  - **total correlation loss** - encourages factors to be independent
    - measures dependence between marginals of the latent vars
    - intractable (requires pass through the whole dset)
    - instead sample $dec_\phi(\mathbf z\vert \mathbf x)$ and create $\prod_j dec_\phi( \mathbf z_i\vert \mathbf x) $ by permuting across the batch dimension
      - now, calculate the kl with the *density-ratio trick* - train a classifier to approximate the ratio from these terms



## disentangled vae in code

```python
# Reconstruction + KL divergence losses summed over all elements and batch
def loss_function(x_reconstructed, x, mu, logvar, beta=1):
  '''
  Params
  ------
  x_reconstructed: torch.Tensor
		Reconstructed input, with values between 0-1
	x: torch.Tensor
		input, values unrestricted
  '''
  
  # reconstruction loss (assuming bernoulli distr.)
  # BCE = sum_i [x_rec_i * log(x_i) + (1 - x_rec_i) * log(1-x_i)]
	rec_loss = F.binary_cross_entropy(x_reconstructed, x, reduction='sum')

  # compactness prior loss
	# 0.5 * sum(1 + log(sigma^2) - mu^2 - sigma^2)
	KLD = -0.5 * torch.sum(1 + logvar - mu.pow(2) - logvar.exp())
  
  # total correlation loss (calculate tc-vae way)
	z_sample = mu + torch.randn_like(exp(0.5 * logvar))
	log_pz, log_qz, log_prod_qzi, log_q_zCx = func(z_sample, mu, logvar)
  # I[z;x] = KL[q(z,x)\vert\vertq(x)q(z)] = E_x[KL[q(z\vertx)\vert\vertq(z)]]
  mi_loss = (log_q_zCx - log_qz).mean()
  # TC[z] = KL[q(z)\vert\vert\prod_i z_i]
  tc_loss = (log_qz - log_prod_qzi).mean()
  # dw_kl_loss is KL[q(z)\vert\vertp(z)] instead of usual KL[q(z\vertx)\vert\vertp(z))]
  dw_kl_loss = (log_prod_qzi - log_pz).mean()
  
	return rec_loss + beta * KLD
```



## how do these terms appear in different papers

- [vae](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) (kingma & welling, 2013)
- [beta-vae](https://openreview.net/references/pdf?id=Sy2fzU9gl) (higgins et al. 2017) - add hyperparameter $\beta$ to weight the compactness prior term
- [beta-vae H](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03599.pdf) (burgess et al. 2018) - add parameter $C$ to control the contribution of the compactness prior term
  - $\overbrace{\mathbb  E_{p_\phi(\mathbf z\vert \mathbf x)}}^{\text{samples}} [ \underbrace{-\log q_{\mathbf \theta} ( \mathbf x\vert \mathbf z)}_{\text{reconstruction loss}} ]      		+ \textcolor{teal}{\beta}\; \vert\sum_i \underbrace{\text{KL} \left(p_\phi( \mathbf z_i\vert \mathbf x)\:\vert\vert\:prior(\mathbf z_i) \right)}_{\text{compactness prior loss}} -C\vert$
  -  C is gradually increased from zero (allowing for a larger compactness prior loss) until good quality reconstruction is achieved
- [factor-vae](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05983) (kim & minh 2018) - adds total correlation loss term
  - computes *total correlation loss term* using discriminator (can we discriminate between the samples when we shuffle over the batch dimension or not?)
  - [beta-TC-VAE = beta-total-correlation VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04942) (chen et al. 2018) - same objective but computed without need for discriminator
    - use minibatch-weighted sampling to compute each of the 3 terms that make up the original VAE *compactness prior loss*
    - main idea is to better approximate $q(z)$ by weighting samples appropriately - biased, but easier to compute
  - [Interpretable VAEs for nonlinear group factor analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06765)
- [Wasserstein Auto-Encoders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.01558.pdf) (tolstikhin et al.) - removes the mutual info part of the loss
  - wasserstein distance = earth-movers distance, how far apart are 2 distrs
  - minimizes wasserstein distance + penalty which is similar to auto-encoding penalty,  without the mutual info term
  - another intuition: rather than map each point to a ball (since VAE adds noise to each latent repr), we only constraint the overall distr of Z, potentially making reconstructions less blurry (but potentially making latent space less smooth)
  - ![wae](assets/wae.png)
- [Adversarial Latent Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04467.pdf) (pidhorskyi et al. 2020)
  - improve quality of generated VAE reconstructions by using a different setup which allows for using a GAN loss
  - ![alae](assets/alae.png)
- [Variational Autoencoders Pursue PCA Directions (by Accident)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06775.pdf)
  - local orthogonality of the embedding transformation
  - prior $p(z)$ is standard normal, so encoder is assumed to be Gaussian with a certain mean, and **diagonal covariance**
  - disentanglement is sensitive to rotations of the latent embeddings but reconstruction err doesn't care
  - for linear autoencoder w/ square-error as reconstruction loss, we recover PCA decomp.
- [A Survey of Inductive Biases for Factorial Representation-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05299) (ridgeway 2016)
  - desiderata
    - **compact**
    - **faithful** - preserve info required for task
    - **explicitly** represent the attributes required for the task at hand
    - **interpretable** by humans
  - factorial representation - attributes are statistically independent and can provide a userful bias for learning
    - "compete" - factors are more orthogonal
    - "cooperate" - factors are more similar
    - bias on distribution of factors
      - PCA - minimize reconstruction err. subject to orthogonal weights
      - ICA - maximize non-Gaussianity (can also have sparse ICA)
    - bias on factors being invariant to certain types of changes
      - ISA (independent subspace analysis) - 2 layer model where first layer is linear, 2nd layer pools first layer (not maxpool, more like avgpool), sparsity at second layer
        - i.e. 1st layer cooperates, 2nd layer competes
      - SOM - forces topographic map by enforcing nearby filters to be similar
      - VQ - vector quantizer - like ISA but first layer filters now compete and 2nd layer cooperates
    - bias in how factors are combined
      - linear combination - PCA/ICA
      - multilinear models - multiplicative interactions between factors (e.g on top of ISA)
      - functional parts - factor components are combined to construct the output
        - ex. NMF - parts can only add, not substract to total output
        - ex. have each pixel in the output be represented by only one factor in a VQ
      - hierarchical layers
        - ex. R-ICA - recursive ICA - run ICA on coefficients from previous layer (after some transformation)
  - supervision bias
    - constraints on some examples
      - e.g. some groups have same value for a factor
      - e.g. some examples have similar distances (basis for MDS = multidimensional scaling)
      - e.g. analogies between examples
      - can do all of these things with auto-encoders

# GANs

## model-based (disentangle during training)

- disentangling architectures
    - [InfoGAN: Interpretable Representation Learning by Information Maximizing Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03657) (chen et al. 2016)
      - encourages $I(x; c)$ to be high for a subset of the latent variables $z$
        - slightly different than vae - defined under the distribution $p(c) p(x\vert c)$ whereas vae uses $p_{data}(x)enc(z\vert x)$
      - mutual info is intractable so optimizes a lower bound
    - [Stylegan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948) (karras et al. 2018)
      - introduced perceptual path length and linear separability to measure the disentanglement property of latent space
      - ![stylegan](assets/stylegan.png)
      - [Stylegan2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958) (karras et al. 2019): ![stylegan2](assets/stylegan2.png)
        - $\psi$ scales the deviation of *w* from the average - $\psi=1$ is original, moving towards 0 improves quality but reduces variety

    - find latent directions for each binary attribute, as directions which separate the classes using linear svm
      - validation accuracies in tab 1 are high...much higher for all data (because they have high confidence level on attribute scores maybe) - for PGGAN but not StyleGAN
    - intro of this paper gives good survey of how people have studied GAN latent space
    - few papers posthoc analyze learned latent repr.
  - [On the "steerability" of generative adversarial networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07171) (jahanian et al. 2020)
    - learn to approximate edits to images, such as zooms
      - linear walk is as effective as more complex non-linear walks for learning this
      - nonlinear setting - learn a neural network which applies a small perturbation in a specific direction (e.g. zooming)
        - to move further in this space, repeatedly apply the function
  - [A Disentangling Invertible Interpretation Network for Explaining Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13166) (esser et al. 2020) - map latent space to interpretable space, with invertible neural network
      - interpretable space factorizes, so is disentangled
      - individual concepts (e.g. color) can use multiple interpretable latent dims
      - instead of user-supplied interpretable concepts, user supplies two sketches which demonstrate a change in a concept - these sketches are used w/ style transfer to create data points which describe the concept
      - alternatively, with no user-supplied concepts, try to get independent components in unsupervised way
  - [Disentangling in Latent Space by Harnessing a Pretrained Generator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07728) (nitzan et al. 2020)
      - learn to map attributes onto latent space of stylegan
      - works using two images at a time and 2 encoders
        - for each image, predict attributes + identity, then mix the attributes
      - results look realy good, but can't vary one attribute at a time (have to transfer all attributes from the new image)

- post-hoc
    - [Explanation by Progressive Exaggeration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00483) (singla et al. 2019)
      - progressively change image to negate the prediction, keeping most features fixed
        - want to learn mapping $I(x, \delta)$ which produces realistic image that changes features by $\delta$
      - 3 losses: **data consistency** (perturbed samples should look real), **prediction changes** (perturbed samples should appropriately alter prediction), **self-consistency** (applying reverse perturbatino should bring x back to original, and $\delta=0$ should return identity)
      - moving finds ways to generate images that do change the wanted attribute (and don't change the others too much)
      - minor
        - used human experiments
        - limited to binary classification
    - [Interpreting Deep Visual Representations via Network Dissection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05611) (zhou et al. 2017)
    
      - obtain image attributes for each z (using classifier, not human labels)
        - this classifier may put bias back in
    
      - to find directions representing an attribute, train a linear model to predict it from z
    - [GAN Dissection: Visualizing and Understanding Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10597) (bau et al. 2018) - identify group of interpretable units based on segmentation of training images

  - start with a known generative model that has an observed set of independent and interpretable factors (e.g. scale, color, etc.) that can be used to simulate data.
  - create a dataset comprised of pairs of generated data for which a single factor is held constant (e.g. a pair of images which have objects with the same color).
  - use the inference network to map each pair of images to a pair of latent variables.
  - train a linear classifier to predict which interpretable factor was held constant based on the latent representations. The accuracy of this predictor is the disentanglement metric score.
